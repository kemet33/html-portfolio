<br/>
<p>
    The reason why this is one of my favorite is the different story 
    line each episode brings while keeping to a general story line. 
    This show will broaden your view of what may be out there if mankind 
    was to take to the sky to explore the known galaxy while meeting different 
    species and forming alliances. This show is for the science inclined imaginative person.

<p>
    Babylon 5 is an epic show of action, betrayal, politics and ancient races with technologies 
    that makes them seems like gods to the younger races. The older races both fight using the younger
    races as proxy for dominance on who thinks it is the best way to teach and noture the younger races.
    The Vorlons thinks love and spirituality is best to bring up the younger races while the Shadows 
    uses wars and brutality.
